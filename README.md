# Introduction

Welcome to the Sensor Robot repository! This repository contains the logic for a simulated car robot that can navigate a labyrinth using sensors. All the physics simulation should be done on CoppeliaSim.

## Main Components

The main component of this repository is `main.cpp`, which contains the logic for the robot. It essentially uses its sensors to navigate through a large and complex labyrinth, making it a great resource for understanding how sensor-based navigation works.

## PlatformIO and Arduino Framework

This project uses PlatformIO, a new generation ecosystem for embedded development. PlatformIO replaces the traditional Arduino IDE and offers more advanced features.

The code in this repository is designed to be compiled using the Arduino framework within PlatformIO. This means you can use all the familiar Arduino libraries and functions when working with this project.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/deobasquiat/sensor-robot.git`
2. Open the project in PlatformIO.
3. Build the project using the PlatformIO's build option.
4. Set up the CoppeliaSim enviorment with the provided file.
5. Import the `main.cpp` file inside the `src/` directory.
6. Run CoppeliaSim simulation.
